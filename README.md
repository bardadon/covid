# covid

In this project, we will be analyzing COVID-19 data from April 2020 to March 2021.

The project will include the following components:
1. __Scheduled data pipeline__ for transferring data from an API to Google BigQuery.
2. Processing, cleaning, and transforming of the data
3. Producing various __analytical dashboards__ using Tableau.
4. __Gradient Boosting model__ for predicting the increase in death cases due to COVID-19.
5. An __API__ for interacting with the Gradient Boosting Model.
